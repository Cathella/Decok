                <p class="text-muted mt-3 mb-5">
                  The first step to a successful kitchen design is to think about what you want in your dream
                  kitchen. To help you understand some of the key decisions you will need to make, we have
                  prepared a simple checklist to walk you through getting started.<br><br>
                  We also suggest you get in touch or visit one of our kitchen design office so you can get a
                  walkthrough of the popular design trends, according to your space, and also ask our kitchen
                  professionals any questions you have about colour, design, timeframes and potential costs.

                <h3 class="font-weight-bold">Design briefing</h3>
                <p class="text-muted mt-3 mb-5">
                  Once you have talked to our design experts and worked out what you want, the next step is to
                  meet our designer and organising an estimate quote. At this initial meeting, the designer
                  collects information about what you want in your new kitchen, or how you want to re-design
                  your existing kitchen.

                  You will be contacted by our customer support team to make an appointment at your home so
                  we can take the final measurements and selections confirmed. We will keep you advised of
                  any timing impacts as your project progresses. In case you already have your own accurate
                  measurements, we will proceed with those.

                      At this stage, the designer will present the concept of your new kitchen. They will have
                      drawn up a floor plan, elevations and 3D images for you to review plus provide an initial
                      quote.

                      This meeting is held at our showroom so that we have easy access to a range of material for
                      you to consider and select from, colours, bench tops, handles etc. Adjustments to your plans
                      can also be made at this meeting.

                      At the end of this meeting, you may be happy to proceed or prefer to have further discussions
                      with your Designer via email, phone or face-to-face, until you are completely happy with
                      your design and selections. Once you are comfortable with your final design, selections and
                      specifications, a contract will need to be signed and a 60% deposit paid before we can

                      proceed. The designer then takes the final plans and contract to our workshop to explain your
                      project with our production team.

                  If your existing kitchen needs to be removed this will happen up to four days before we start
                  installing your new kitchen. We will take care to ensure the dust and debris is minimised.
                  Once the old kitchen has been removed, any plastering, plumbing and electrical works that
                  need to be adjusted will be patched before installation. This can take approximately 1-2 days
                  before installation. All these timeframes will be advised upfront so you can plan ahead.
