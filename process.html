                  The first step to a successful kitchen design is to think about what you want in your dream kitchen. 
                  To help you understand some of the key decisions you will need to make we have prepared a simple checklist 
                  to walk you through getting started.<br>
                  We also suggest you get in touch or visit one of our kitchen showrooms so you can see the latest kitchen finishes 
                  up close and ask our kitchen professionals any questions you have about colour, design, timeframes and potential costs.

                <p class="text-muted mt-3 mb-5">
                  Once you have talked to our showroom experts and worked out what you want, 
                  the next step is to meet our designer and organising a quote.
                  At this initial meeting the designer collects information about what you want in your new kitchen.

                      This meeting is held at one of our showrooms so we have easy access to a range of material for you to consider and select from including door styles, colours, bench tops, handles etc. Adjustments to your plans can also be made at this meeting.

                      At the end of this meeting you may be happy to proceed or prefer to have further discussions with your Designer via email, phone or face-to-face…until you are completely happy with your design and selections. Once you are comfortable with your final design, selections and specifications, a contract will need to be signed and a 10% deposit paid before we can proceed. The designer then takes the final plans and contract to our manufacturing facility to debrief your project with our production team.
