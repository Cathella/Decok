                  The first step to a successful kitchen design is to think
                  about what you want in your dream kitchen. To help you
                  understand some of the key decisions you will need to make, we
                  have prepared a simple checklist to walk you through getting
                  started.<br /><br />
                  We also suggest you get in touch or visit one of our kitchen
                  design office so you can get a walkthrough of the popular
                  design trends, according to your space, and also ask our
                  kitchen professionals any questions you have about colour,
                  design, timeframes and potential costs.

                  Once you have talked to our design experts and worked out what
                  you want, the next step is to meet our designer and organising
                  an estimate quote. At this initial meeting, the designer
                  collects information about what you want in your new kitchen,
                  or how you want to re-design your existing kitchen.

                  timing impacts as your project progresses. In case you already
                  have your own accurate measurements, we will proceed with

                      60% deposit paid before we can proceed. The designer then
                      takes the final plans and contract to our workshop to
                      explain your project with our production team.

                  Once the old kitchen has been removed, any plastering,
                  plumbing and electrical works that need to be adjusted will be
                  patched before installation. This can take approximately 1-2
